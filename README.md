Built a deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into clothing categories. Preprocessed grayscale images, designed a multi-layer neural network, and achieved high classification accuracy using softmax activation and categorical cross-entropy loss. Evaluated model performance through accuracy metrics and visualized predictions.
